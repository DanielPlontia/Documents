(F1) High Reliability on Coding Trainer Server 22.03 and 22.05
Coding Trainer Server can be impossible to use by failure. Failures can be caused by fault on software or physical damage. In the event of a problem with the server, the user experiences great inconvenience. If these cases are repeated, the user loses confidence in the system and is not used.
(F2) High Reliability on Dispatcher 22.05 F2
If a problem occurs in the dispatcher, Users may not be able to access the server side. The Dispatcher does not perform many functions and each function may be processed in a short time.
(F3) High Reliability on GPT-4 Service 22.05
A problem may also occur in the server of the GPT-4 service. They may have tried to secure reliability in their own way, but errors may occur.
(F4) Occur Software Fault 22.03
Coding Trainer system may cause a fault in internal software. This may lead to poor performance or service failure.
(F5) Server Recovering upon a failure 22.03
If the software and dataset are not recovered after server failure, the service may not be provided.


(C1) Fault Tolerance of Coding Trainer Server (Relevant to F1) 22.05 C1
The Coding Trainer Server should be fault tolerant. For fault tolerance, three elements should be satisfied: fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery. The system should be operated so that users cannot feel it even in the event of a fault.
(C2) Distributing service request (Relevant to F1) 22.03 C2
The system should be able to manage so that requests are not concentrated on a specific server when there are multiple physical servers that provide services. It should be possible to maintain the minimum performance by lowering the service latency.
(C3) Recoverable Dispatcher (Relevant to F2) 22.05 C2
Dispatcher should recoverable. Dispatcher fault will not occur much, but if it occurs, the Web Browser will not be properly assigned to the server. Therefore, it is necessary to recover as soon as possible.
(C4) Fault Detection and Notification (Relevant to F4) 22.03 C4
The Coding Trainer System should be able to detect fault and give notice to the staff for recovery.
(C5) Handling Software Agent Fault (Relevant to F4) 22.03 C5
The target system should detect and handle software agent fault to restart them to normal operation.
(C6) Minimize the impact on Fault on GPT-4 Service 22.05 C3
If a fault occurs in the GPT-4 Service, recovery of the fault must be made. However, this service is not a service that we can restore like the Coding Trainer Server. In the case of GPT-4 service, it is very important to user because this is a target system's main business point.
(C6) System Recovery (Relevant to F5) 22.03 C6
The Coding Trainer System should detect and handle corruptions on delivered data and current state to offer normal service.
